# AOS Factory Builder Changelog

Tracks changes to the reusable builder framework files and their packaging (§14.5,
§16.9). Numbered by `spec_version` but distinct from the design
`aos-factory-revision-history.md`: that file is the **design** audit trail and
lives with the spec; this changelog tracks **framework-file and packaging**
changes and ships inside the plugin (§28). When the framework is distributed as a
Claude plugin, entries note the plugin version.

Entries are in reverse chronological order (newest first).

| spec_version | Date       | Plugin version | Summary |
|--------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| 2.2.3        | 2026-07-11 | 2.2.3 (packaged, not published) | Plugin packaging fix (design spec §28.2, runbook §36.3): the rendered design artifacts `agent-catalog.yaml`, `agent-specs/` (all 15 agents' `profile.md` + `interviews.md`), and `aos-interviews.md` now ship at the plugin root, byte-identical to their factory-root sources — previously the plugin shipped only skills, templates, README, and this changelog, so the builder skills' required inputs were absent from a plugin-only install. Both `SKILL.md` resolution notes and the plugin README updated to state the artifacts resolve at the plugin root. No changes to the artifacts or builders themselves |
| 2.2.2        | 2026-07-11 | 2.2.2 (packaged, not published) | Re-render of the full framework from `spec_version` 2.2.2 (runbook §36.2) after deletion of the prior framework. Carries in the 2.1.4–2.2.1 design changes already reflected in the rendered artifacts and `/builders/build-aos.md` (purpose-category agent bundles, quarterly-review retirement, Rhythmic Workflow Scheduling with single `@`-path task instructions); 2.2.2 itself is a version reconciliation only — authored files restamped, no content changes |
| 2.1.1        | 2026-07-09 | not published  | Re-render of the full framework from `spec_version` 2.1.1 (§4.1 `/outputs` subtree fix, §16.6 spec_version-stamp fix carried in from the design spec) — no structural changes to the builder files themselves, all frontmatter restamped |
| 2.1.0        | 2026-07-06 | not published  | Initial framework generation: root entry, generic build engine + master AOS builder, and rendered design artifacts (catalog, agent-specs, aos-interviews) |

## 2.2.3 — Plugin packaging fix: ship the rendered design artifacts (2026-07-11)

Packaging-only release closing the gap that made a plugin-only install unable to
run a spec-faithful build. The builder skills hard-require `agent-catalog.yaml`,
`agent-specs/`, and `aos-interviews.md` ("resolve them from the installed
factory / plugin context"), but the §28.2 plugin layout and runbook §36.3
generation steps never copied them into the package. Design spec 2.2.3 adds the
three rendered artifacts to the required plugin layout (byte-identical to their
factory-root sources; a package missing any of them is invalid), and the plugin
was regenerated accordingly. The `SKILL.md` resolution notes and the plugin
README now state the artifacts ship at the plugin root. The artifacts and
builder files themselves are unchanged from 2.2.2.

## 2.2.2 — Full re-render at version reconciliation (2026-07-11)

Full re-render of the AOS Factory framework files from `spec_version` 2.2.2
(runbook §36.2), following deletion of the prior framework files. Between the
last generation (2.1.1) and this one, the design advanced through 2.1.4–2.2.1
(purpose-category default agent bundles in `aos-interviews.md`; retirement of
the Quarterly Review Workflow into the Monthly Review; the new Rhythmic
Workflow Scheduling step in `build-aos.md` with the single `@`-path
Scheduled-Task instruction rule) — those changes were already applied to the
rendered artifacts and `/builders/build-aos.md` as the spec evolved, and this
generation carries them forward. Spec 2.2.2 itself was a §36.1 version
reconciliation (runbook frontmatter drift) with no content changes, so the
authored files are restamped to 2.2.2 with no substantive edits, and the
rendered artifacts (catalog, agent-specs, aos-interviews) are verified
byte-identical to their `design-spec/` sources, which retain their own
per-file `spec_version` stamps (catalog 2.2.0, interviews 2.1.4, profiles
2.2.0/2.2.1).

## 2.1.1 — Version-sync re-render (2026-07-09)

Full re-render of the AOS Factory framework files from `spec_version` 2.1.1
(runbook §36.2), following a manual deletion of the prior 2.1.0 framework. The
design spec advanced from 2.1.0 → 2.1.1 via a §36.1 Design Readiness Review that
resolved two functionality-impacting inconsistencies (revision history 2.1.1):
the §4.1 instance tree gained the missing `/outputs` subtree, and the §16.6
guide-skeleton metadata line gained the missing `spec_version` stamp. Neither
change altered the content of the four authored builder files — the `/outputs`
subtree was already present in `/builders/build-aos.md`'s Folder Structure to
Create, and §16.6 is generated dynamically at instance-build time from the
design spec rather than hardcoded here. This generation therefore carries the
four authored files forward unchanged in substance, restamped to 2.1.1, and
re-copies the three rendered-artifact categories fresh from their (already
2.1.1) `design-spec/` sources.

Framework files generated (§35.2):

1. **Root entry** — `/build-aos.md` (`file_type: builder_entry`), a short pointer
   to `/builders/build-aos.md` (§8.3).

2. **Builders** — `/builders/build-aos.md` (`aos_builder`, §12.1, the master AOS
   builder) and `/builders/build-agent.md` (`agent_builder`, §12, the generic
   build engine).

3. **Rendered design artifacts** (read-only inside instances, §14.8) — a factory-root
   copy of `agent-catalog.yaml` (§7A.4), the `agent-specs/[agent-name]-agent/`
   folders holding `profile.md` (§7B) and `interviews.md` (§7C) for all 15
   §7.3 agents, and `aos-interviews.md` (§7C/§12.1). Each is rendered from its
   `design-spec/` source.

4. **Changelog** — this file (`builder_changelog`, §16.9).

Every generated file's frontmatter is stamped with `spec_version: 2.1.1` (§35.1,
§15). No user-specific AOS instance was generated in this phase (§35.1).

## 2.1.0 — Initial framework generation (2026-07-06)

First generation of the AOS Factory framework files from `spec_version` 2.1.0
(runbook §36.2), following a manual deletion of the prior framework. This is an
internal milestone: no plugin is published at 2.1.0 (§36.3 plugin generation is a
separate, later step).

Framework files generated (§35.2):

1. **Root entry** — `/build-aos.md` (`file_type: builder_entry`), a short pointer
   to `/builders/build-aos.md` (§8.3).

2. **Builders** — `/builders/build-aos.md` (`aos_builder`, §12.1, the master AOS
   builder) and `/builders/build-agent.md` (`agent_builder`, §12, the generic
   build engine). The former 14 per-agent builders are collapsed into the single
   generic engine (§8.1); their interview content lives on as the §7C scripts.

3. **Rendered design artifacts** (read-only inside instances, §14.8) — a factory-root
   copy of `agent-catalog.yaml` (§7A.4), the `agent-specs/[agent-name]-agent/`
   folders holding `profile.md` (§7B) and `interviews.md` (§7C) for all 15
   §7.3 agents, and `aos-interviews.md` (§7C/§12.1). Each is rendered from its
   `design-spec/` source.

4. **Changelog** — this file (`builder_changelog`, §16.9).

Every generated file's frontmatter is stamped with `spec_version: 2.1.0` (§35.1,
§15). No user-specific AOS instance was generated in this phase (§35.1).
